    <h1>Who We Are</h1>
    <p>
      All Clear Collective (ACC) is a group of dancers, teachers, and makers based in the Netherlands.
      We create performances, workshops, and artistic encounters that explore movement as connection —
      between people, between ideas, between worlds.

        <h2>Our Work</h2>
        <p>
          We move between teaching and performing, from intimate studio practice to large-scale productions.
          Each project begins with curiosity — what happens when we meet, move, and create together?
          Through dance, we build spaces of honesty, rhythm, and imagination.

        <h2>Our Approach</h2>
        <p>
          Collaboration is at the heart of everything we do.
          We share authorship, support each other’s voices, and believe in creative responsibility.
          Every dancer brings a different story — together, we form a collective body that keeps moving.
