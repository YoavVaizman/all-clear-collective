      <h2>All Clear Sessions</h2>
      <p>
        A recurring platform where artists and audiences meet through movement.
        Each session is improvised, spontaneous, and rooted in presence — a space for discovery,
        not performance. <em>All Clear Sessions</em> embodies the collective’s ongoing practice
        of transparency, listening, and shared authorship.

    <div class="project-info">
      <h2>Soft Armor</h2>
      <p>
        A physical study on strength and vulnerability. <em>Soft Armor</em> unfolds as a series of
        movements that question what protection means — when the body becomes both shield and language.
        The work explores resilience through sensitivity, inviting the audience to witness honesty in motion.

    <div class="project-info">
      <h2>Hope Frequency</h2>
      <p>
        A live performance that listens to the body as an instrument of persistence. Dancers pulse, breathe,
        and repeat — finding rhythm in exhaustion. <em>Hope Frequency</em> is a meditation on the practice of
        staying in motion when everything wants to stop.

    <div class="project-info">
      <h2>Grounded Light</h2>
      <p>
        A site-specific performance that transforms urban and natural spaces into temporary stages.
        <em>Grounded Light</em> explores how we move through our surroundings — and how our surroundings move us.
        The piece merges choreography, sound, and architecture into one breathing organism.
